I don’t know how you have that much patience, but I’m grateful you do.</p>

                    <p>I don’t even know where to start, because every time I think about you, my heart gets full. You came into my life so quietly, but you changed everything in the best way.</p>
        <p>You’re not just my partner—you’re my safe place. The person I want to talk to when something good happens, and the person I need when life feels heavy. With you, even the simplest moments feel warm and meaningful.</p>

        <p>I love the way you are—your innocence, your cuteness, your patience, and that calm strength you carry. You handle so much, you still show up for people, and somehow you still have a soft heart. Watching you makes me proud… and honestly, it makes me want to become better too.</p>

        <p>And I know I’m not perfect. Sometimes I don’t express enough, sometimes I get busy, sometimes I don’t give you the time you deserve. But please know this—my feelings for you are real, and I’m always choosing you, even on the difficult days.</p>

        <p>This Valentine’s Day, I just want to say thank you—for loving me, for understanding me, for being you. I’m not promising a fairy tale. I’m promising something real: I’ll stand with you, I’ll listen, I’ll respect you, and I’ll keep loving you—more and more, every day.</p>

        <p>You make my world brighter just by being in it. And I’m really lucky that I get to call you mine.</p>
